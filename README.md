 I used the Flickr API to call usernames to get their NSID from there I inserted that JSON NSID data into another API endpoint to call on the Flickr Users photos where they are appended to a galleryDiv where they are displayed in a grid of 12 user photos. although there are a couple of bugs. I know now why frameworks make developers' lives so much easier.
